# Basketball Scoreboard üèÄ

## About the Project

This web app is a simple basketball scoreboard that keeps track of the games score. For a freethrow you tap **+1**, for a lay-up or shot from inside the paint, tap **+2**. For a distant three-point shot tap the **+3** and the scoreboard will increment the count appropriately.
